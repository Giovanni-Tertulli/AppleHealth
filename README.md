## Visualising my Apple Health data.

data_processor.py reads three .csv files from the 'source_files' folder:
- insulin.csv
- gluccose.csv
- energy.csv

After processing them, the dataframes are fed to graphs.py.
It produces the visualisation and saves them as images in the 'output_figures' folder.
